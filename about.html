        <h1>Guess A GUID... What!? </h1>
<h2>What is this? It doesn't make any sense!?</h2>

<p>First: what is a GUID?</p>

<p>A GUID (short for <strong>G</strong>lobally <strong>U</strong>nique <strong>ID</strong>entifier) is a big number, a huge number, a gigantic number. You might think your grandpa is pretty old but that's nothing compared to how big a GUID is. GUIDs are so big that they aren't written in decimal format (base 10, using the digits 0-9) instead they're written in hexadecimal format (base 16) and use all the digits (0 to 9) plus the letters A to F. </p>

<p>If you were to try and guess a GUID (without any hints about whether you were too high or too low) it would take you so many guesses that you would miss your next birthday, the one after that, the one after that, and so on until long after the entire universe had turned cold and empty and everyone you knew was long dead and forgotten, even the really memorable people like your cousin Steve who was on that reality TV show once.</p>

<p>But luckily for you, this guess a GUID game will tell you if you are too high or too low. So you can narrow in to the right answer very quickly without missing ANY of your birthdays. But even when you are given those precious hints it still takes most people almost 200 guesses before they arrive at the exact right answer. Guessing a GUID is hard work and only the bravest most exceptional people are up to the challenge. Are you ready?</p>
